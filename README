python + django + beautiful soup

getScores(date) -- scrape current scores from mlb scoreboard for given date. return array of tuple of ((team1, score1), (team2, score2) where scores are empty strings for games that have not yet started

getRecords() -- scrape standings for wins/losses/streak/last 10. return array of tuples (team, wins, losses, streak, last 10)

scraping strategy:

every 30 seconds: get today's scores and fill relevant teams' info.
once a day: for teams where no games are found today, check the next day. continue until november 10th is hit or all teams have info.

limitations:
if a game runs past midnight (unlikely) its score will be replaced if there is a scheduled game the next day
