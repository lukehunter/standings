getContests(date) -- scrape contests from mlb scoreboard/schedule for given 
date. return array of dictionaries (hometeam, homescore, awayteam, awayscore, 
start_time) 

getStandings() -- scrape standings for wins/losses/streak/last 10. return array 
of dictionaries using column headings

scraping strategy:

every 30 seconds: get today's scores and fill relevant teams' info. check
   rankings and update (dirty polling in a place where yahoo doesn't normally
   auto refresh..could be bad)
every day: for teams where no games are found today, check the next day. 
continue until november 10th is hit or all teams have info.

limitations:
if a game runs past midnight (unlikely) its score will be replaced if there is 
a scheduled game the next day? or will the contest stay up on the scoreboard
for the next day and will be ok?
